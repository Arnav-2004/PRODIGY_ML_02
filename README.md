# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

Thrilled to share a significant facet of my role as a Machine Learning Intern at Prodigy Infotech! My second responsibility entailed the development of a K-Means Clustering model for customer segmentation, a task that delved deep into the realms of exploratory data analysis and sophisticated analytical techniques.

The project's foundation was laid through a meticulous exploratory data analysis phase, where I unearthed valuable insights into the intricacies of the raw data. Subsequently, I embarked on the crucial process of selecting the optimal number of clusters, a decision that significantly influences the model's efficacy. Leveraging Silhouette Analysis, I gauged the separation distance between resulting clusters, utilizing a silhouette plot to visually assess the closeness of each point to its neighboring clusters.

Silhouette coefficients, a crucial metric in this context, provided a nuanced understanding of the cluster assignments. A coefficient near +1 indicated a substantial separation distance from neighboring clusters, signifying robust segmentation. Conversely, values around 0 signaled proximity to the decision boundary, while negative values hinted at potential misalignments in the cluster assignments.

This undertaking not only broadened my understanding of clustering methodologies but also underscored the significance of leveraging advanced analytical tools for precise model parameterization. Excited to apply these insights and continue evolving in the dynamic landscape of machine learning.
